@article{Hin05,
%abstract = {A new discretization concept for optimal control problems with control constraints is introduced which utilizes for the discretization of the control variable the relation between adjoint state and control. Its key feature is not to discretize the space of admissible controls but to implicitly utilize the first order optimality conditions and the discretization of the state and adjoint equations for the discretization of the control. For discrete controls obtained in this way an optimal error estimate is proved. The application to control of elliptic equations is discussed. Finally it is shown that the new concept is numerically implementable with only slight increase in program management. A numerical test confirms the theoretical investigations.},

%abstract = {In this paper we investigate the POD discretisation method for linear second order evolution equations. We present error estimates for two different choices of snapshot sets, one consisting of solution snapshots only and one consisting of solution snapshots and their derivatives up to second order. We show that the results of 7 for parabolic equations can be extended to linear second order evolution equations and that the derivative snapshot POD method behaves better than the classical one for small time steps. Numerical comparisons of the different approaches are presented underlining the theoretical results.},

Because of the wide (and growing) use of optimization in science, engineering, economics, and industry, it is essential for students and practitioners alike to develop an understanding of optimization algorithms. Knowledge of the capabilities and limitations of these algorithms leads to a better understanding of their impact on various applications, and points the way to future research on improving and extending optimization algorithms and software. Our goal in this book is to give a comprehensive description of the most powerful, state-of-the-art, techniques for solving continuous optimization problems. By presenting the motivating ideas for each algorithm, we try to stimulate the reader's intuition and make the technical details easier to follow. Formal mathematical requirements are kept to a minimum. Because of our focus on continuous problems, we have omitted discussion of important optimization topics such as discrete and stochastic optimization.},
