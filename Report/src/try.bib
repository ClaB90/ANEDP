abstract = {An algorithm for efficient solution of control constrained optimal control problems is proposed and analyzed. It is based on an active set strategy involving primal as well as dual variables. For discretized problems sufficient conditions for convergence in finitely many iterations are given. Numerical examples are given and the role of the strict complementarity condition is discussed.},

@article{Hinze2005,
abstract = {A new discretization concept for optimal control problems with control constraints is introduced which utilizes for the discretization of the control variable the relation between adjoint state and control. Its key feature is not to discretize the space of admissible controls but to implicitly utilize the first order optimality conditions and the discretization of the state and adjoint equations for the discretization of the control. For discrete controls obtained in this way an optimal error estimate is proved. The application to control of elliptic equations is discussed. Finally it is shown that the new concept is numerically implementable with only slight increase in program management. A numerical test confirms the theoretical investigations.},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate the POD discretisation method for linear second order evolution equations. We present error estimates for two different choices of snapshot sets, one consisting of solution snapshots only and one consisting of solution snapshots and their derivatives up to second order. We show that the results of 7 for parabolic equations can be extended to linear second order evolution equations and that the derivative snapshot POD method behaves better than the classical one for small time steps. Numerical comparisons of the different approaches are presented underlining the theoretical results.},
